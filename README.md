💳 Razorpay Payment Setup
To enable online payments, you need to configure Razorpay:
* Create an account at Razorpay
* Go to the Dashboard → API Keys section.
* Generate a new Key ID and Key Secret.

Open your settings.py file and add the keys:

# Razorpay Configuration
1.RAZORPAY_KEY_ID = "your_key_id"
2.RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET = "your_secret_key"

In your checkout or payment view, use these keys to integrate Razorpay’s order API.
Make sure to use test mode keys while developing, and live keys when deploying.
